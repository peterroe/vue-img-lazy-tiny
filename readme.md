## Publish your component

> Before you publish your component, you must give your component a new name in order to prevent conflicts with other people's component names.

Update `package.json`, and take a unique `name` for your `npm package`:

```diff
{
- "name": "vue-component-starter"
+ "name": "your-component-name"
}
```

You better also update the registered component name in `src/index.ts`:

```diff
export function install(app: App) {
- app.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)
+ app.component('yourComponentName', MyComponent)
}
```

Run `pnpm build` again to get the right files.

Make sure your are logged into [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and run:

```shell
$ pnpm release
```

For more details about publish, please check [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

## Deploy demo online

You can debug your components online in `demo/App.vue`, and they can be deployed directly.

Just run:

```shell
$ pnpm deploy:demo
```

Then visit <https://peterroe.github.io/vue-component-starter/>

Notice you have to make sure the `base` of `demo/vite.config.ts` is your github repository name:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // keep the same name as your github repos
  base: 'vue-component-starter',
})
```
